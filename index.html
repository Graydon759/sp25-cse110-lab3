    <h4>New Topic: The Pomodoro Technique and Timer</h4>
    <p>The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.
        It uses a kitchen timer to break work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length,
        separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro,from the Italian word for tomato,
        after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used while a university student</p>

        <summary>Summary</summary>
        <p>The pomodoro method uses a timer that you set for around 25 minutes. During this time you are
            focused on during work. Then you take a 5 minute break after. After doing 4 rounds of this you
            take a longer break (somewhere around 20/30 minutes)
