    <h4>New Topic: The Pomodoro Technique and Timer</h4>
    <p>The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.
        It uses a kitchen timer to break work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length,
        separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro,from the Italian word for tomato,
        after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used while a university student</p>
    <p>This is a picture of the timer mentioned</p>

        <summary>Summary</summary>
        <p>The pomodoro method uses a timer that you set for around 25 minutes. During this time you are
            focused on during work. Then you take a 5 minute break after. After doing 4 rounds of this you
            take a longer break (somewhere around 20/30 minutes)

For the following two, you can simply take a 30 second pretend audio recording & video recording to use, we are just trying to get you familiar with the <audio> and <video> elements. Yes, you must have both audio and video elements, and yes, you can use the audio from the video you took for the audio element, it just has to be in a separate audio file.
